# WhatsApp-Controlled Google Drive Automation using n8n

This project demonstrates a fully automated workflow using **n8n**, **WhatsApp**, **Google Drive**, and **Supabase PostgreSQL**. The workflow allows you to control Google Drive files and folders directly via WhatsApp commands.

## üõ† Tools and Stack

- **n8n** (Docker & Render deployment)
- **WhatsApp Sandbox / Twilio API** for messaging
- **Google Drive** for file/folder management
- **Supabase PostgreSQL** for logging and metadata storage
- **Render** to host n8n workflow for free (forever free plan)

## üì¶ Workflow Overview

1. **Webhook Node**: Receives WhatsApp messages as POST requests.  
2. **Parse Command Node**: Extracts the command, folder, file, media, and sender info.  
3. **Switch Node**: Determines the command type (UPLOAD, DELETE, RENAME, SUMMARY, LIST).  
4. **Google Drive Nodes**: Perform file/folder operations like listing, renaming, uploading, or deleting.  
5. **Supabase Node**: Stores logs and file metadata for tracking.  
6. **Reply Node**: Sends confirmation back to WhatsApp (success/failure or invalid command).

## üìã Supported WhatsApp Commands

| Command | Example | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **DELETE** | `DELETE/Reports/new` | Deletes the file `new` from the folder `Reports`. |
| **LIST** | `LIST /certificates` | Lists all files inside the folder `certificates`. |
| **RENAME** | `RENAME/certificates/Delloite.pdf newname Delloite` | Renames `Delloite.pdf` in `certificates` folder to `Delloite`. |
| **SUMMARY** | `SUMMARY /feeReceip` | Provides a summary of the contents of the folder `feeReceip`. |
| **UPLOAD** | `UPLOAD /folder file.pdf` | Uploads a new file `file.pdf` to the folder `folder`. |
